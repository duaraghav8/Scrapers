# Scrapers
Scrapers I coded for my personal use during freelancing and reference.

NOTE: I don't expect the audience to understand these scripts. They are only for my personal use. What better place to back up code than Github.

This repo contains scripts & programs which I made quickly as a hack to get shit done, its rough, dirty and every bad word you can attach to code.
